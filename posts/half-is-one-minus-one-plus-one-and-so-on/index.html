      <p>There is a mathematics question:
$$1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 &hellip;$$ for infinitely
you might know the answer is 1/2 by a simple proof:
$$\text{Let}\ S = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 &hellip;$$
$$S = 1 - (1 - 1 + 1 - 1 &hellip;)$$
$$S = 1 - S$$
$$S = \frac 1 2$$</p>
<p>The result seems quite not make sense since when you calculate that step by step,
it always return 0 or 1.
So how is it possible? let&rsquo;s try to reverse the answers:
$$\frac 1 2 = (1-\frac 1 2) = (1 - (1 - \frac 1 2)) = (1 - (1 - (1 - \frac 1 2))) = (1 - (1 - (1 - (1 - &hellip;)))) = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 &hellip;$$</p>
<p>It does make sense, but why we cannot calculate 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 &hellip; directly?
It&rsquo;s because it was calculated step by step and will never be infinite!</p>
<p>I also write a simple script of it
